    <h1> March Madness Odds </h1>
    <br>
    <p>The odds for the March Madness Final Four are constantly shifting as the tournament progresses, influenced by team performance, injuries, and betting trends. Powerhouse programs with deep rosters and strong regular-season records typically open with the best odds, but upsets and Cinderella runs can dramatically alter the landscape. Sportsbooks analyze advanced metrics like efficiency ratings, strength of schedule, and historical trends to set odds, making teams with elite coaching and star players the favorites. However, unpredictable elements—such as a hot shooting streak or lockdown defense—can propel underdogs to the Final Four, making betting on March Madness both thrilling and uncertain.</p>
